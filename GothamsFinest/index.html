              <h2>Explore the Beginning</h2>
              <p><b>Bruce Wayne</b> was just eight years old when his life was shattered forever. Raised in wealth and
                privilege,
                he was the only son of <b>Thomas and Martha Wayne</b>, a powerful and charitable couple who were among
                Gotham’s
                elite. The Waynes led a life of luxury, often attending high-society events, charity galas, and nights
                at
                the theater.<br>

                <br>One fateful evening, after watching The Mark of Zorro at a grand Gotham theater, the family decided
                to
                take a shortcut through Crime Alley on their way home. There, they were confronted by a desperate mugger
                named <b>Joe Chill</b>, who demanded their money and valuables. Despite their compliance, Chill
                ruthlessly
                gunned
                down both Thomas and Martha before fleeing into the night, leaving young Bruce alone, horrified, and
                forever changed.<br>

                <br>That night, Bruce made a silent vow: he would dedicate his life to ensuring no one else suffered the
                same tragedy. Over the years, he pushed himself to the limits, training in martial arts, criminology,
                and
                advanced technology. When a bat crashed through his study window, he saw it as a symbol of fear and
                rebirth—thus, <b>Batman</b> was born.<br>

                <br>Though he initially worked alone, Batman has since taken on many allies in his crusade. He mentored
                multiple Robins, including <b>Dick Grayson</b>, <b>Jason Todd</b>, <b>Tim Drake</b>, and <b>Damian
                  Wayne</b>, and formed strong bonds
                with <b>Alfred Pennyworth</b>, his ever-loyal butler, and <b>Commissioner Jim Gordon</b>, one of
                Gotham’s
                few
                incorruptible cops. He also fought alongside the <b>Justice League</b>, standing alongside heroes like
                <b>Superman</b>
                and <b>Wonder Woman</b>.<br>

                <br>Despite his vast resources and unmatched skill, Bruce Wayne remains defined by the tragedy of that
                night in Crime Alley—forever walking the line between vengeance and justice as Gotham’s <b>Dark
                  Knight</b>.

                        for the Cowl (2009), Dick Grayson—the original Robin and, at the time, Nightwing—took up the
                        mantle of Batman. <br>This comic also marks the debut of Bruce Wayne’s biological son, Damian
                        Wayne, as Robin, becoming the partner to Dick’s Batman. The two would become a formidable pair,
                        right up until the return of Bruce Wayne and his retaking of the Batman mantle.</p>
